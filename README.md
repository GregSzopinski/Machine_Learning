Some ML projects to show my progress

## Predict if someone will earn over 50k $ anually
Adut AKA Census Income dataset. Classification on public data. I generated some new features and used tree-based methods (CART, Random Forest, XGBoost). Even with simpler methods results seem promising. This kind of information can help target some products, offers, ideas etc. in a better way. You'll find here some examples of hypermeter optmization (manual or bayesian with hyperopt)

## Drug Consumption
Another classification, this time on drug-related data from UCI ML Repository. Many classification problems are associated with this data - I decided to predict if someone is cannabis user. This is my small step to 'de-demonize' this drug. Simple but fun.

## Allstate
NN and XGBoost regression on dataset from Kaggle Allstate Claims Severity competition. Quite good results, but still some room for improvements. This was part of my course work during first tier/edition of [DataWorkshop](http://www.dataworkshop.eu/)
